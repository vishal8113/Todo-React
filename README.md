# React Todo App

This is a simple Todo app built using React, leveraging the Context API for state management, Tailwind CSS for styling, and browser local storage for data persistence.

## Features

- **Add Todos**: Easily add new tasks to your list.
- **Toggle Todos**: Mark tasks as completed or incomplete.
- **Delete Todos**: Remove tasks from your list.
- **Data Persistence**: Your to-do list is stored in the browser's local storage, so you won't lose your tasks when you refresh the page.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Context API**: React's built-in state management solution for managing global state.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for building custom designs quickly.
- **Local Storage**: Browser local storage is used to persist todo data between sessions.
